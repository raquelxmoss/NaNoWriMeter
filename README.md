# [NaNoWriMeter](http://nanowrimeter.herokuapp.com)
When thinking about NaNoWriMo this year, I considered that it would be nice to see graphs of my story as it progresses -- how many words do I write per day? How frequently do I mention a character? What sort of emotions are being explored?

Intrigued by the idea, I decided to get a quick MVP up before NaNoWriMo started. And that's where we are now. Currently, users can login with Github, select a Github repo to watch (public repos only, sorry!), and submit their daily work. NaNoWriMeter will store their day's work as a snippet, along with the relevant git commits.

## Where to from here?
I want to create a d3.js front-end for NaNoWriMeter that gives users the graphs and charts and word clouds they want. I want to enable a data-driven, reflective writing process. Ultimately this may not be helpful for NaNoWriMo folks, who traditionally write Hemmingway style, but I feel like this might be useful. In any case, it's a nice project for procrastination when my novel-writing is going poorly.
